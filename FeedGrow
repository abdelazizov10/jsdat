After your level 10, you can definitely hunt something small and buy a new fish. Oh, and that shoal of tiny little sardines you keep seeing? You don’t need to hunt those, just swallow them and you get a decent amount"

Deathmatch is the fun mode because you can grow as big as the entire map, and more! The screen will shake and it will get super laggy if your level 500 or more. And keep in mind that other fish will try to hunt you more in this mode. I was a level 11 Bibos really far in the shallows when a mahi mahi attacked me."

      "Content":"Survival is easy. Its not as fun as Deathmatch, because everybody knows now that Deathmatch has the unfair advantage that allows you to grow as big as you please, survival is what I like to imagine as the beginner’s mode. You start as a reef fish, but whats this? “I’M AN EGG?” You exclaim, TIME SLOWS AND THE FIERY DEVICE GLOWS WITH EVILNESS"

      "Content":"No, just kidding. But the answer to the first part was, of course you’re and egg, its survival! The computer even tells you this–press space until you hatch. When you hatch, you are a very stupid-looking ‘fry’ that is in need of food. Just go for starfish and barnicles, preferably starfish-they give you more exp than barnicles. Sense you’re a reef fish, you only have 3 stages until adulthood awaits. When you do reach adulthood, to earn orange coin thingies you need to breed and have babies. Sounds weird, right? It gets weirder."
