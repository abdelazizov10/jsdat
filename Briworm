People started speculating on the creature, until a drawing of the creature started spreading on the internet, on which it is written \"Bridge Worm\", giving the creature its name.

He comments that the facial markings of the Worm's false face become more defined to assist in hunting as they get older, confirming that the artwork is of an adult Bridge Worm. On Twitter, he has revealed several more details about the biology of the Bridge Worms. In earlier stages of their lifecycle, they can move from bridge to bridge, until they adhere. If they cannot find prey, many shrivel up most likely due to hunger, but some are strong enough to migrate someplace else. When it is a 3–4 foot long baby, its arms and false face are not developed yet. Younger Bridge Worms' eyes cannot focus properly yet, as shown by the outward-facing pupils, though it doesn't need sight to live off of passing prey due to its false face that lures them in. As it gets bigger and hungrier though, its eyes slowly become more developed, allowing it to stare at its prey as it devours them alive.\n\n",

Underneath the flap, it reveals a horrific grin on its face with 36 human-like teeth. The nose is similar to a human's underneath the skin, proving the fact that the flap is its skin. The tissue on The Bridge Worm's 'real face' is cellular near-identical to humans, but has some flaws. The eyes of The Bridge Worms are extremely misaligned and disorienting as they bounce around while running. Usually, this flap goes up when chasing someone (presumably due to the wind of running 25 kph but there is evidence that proves otherwise). It eats its prey, usually by crushing the preys' skull and spine before ripping said prey in half and is licked up with its tongue. It has a running speed at approximately 25 kilometers per hour, and it has incredible endurance and lengths traveled while running has reached over 125 kilometers before resting/giving up on prey.
