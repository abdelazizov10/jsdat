We were sent to explore an abandoned warehouse, because there were reports of people going missing around there. There were three other people in the group, let's just call them John, Paul, and James. Anyways, I don't know why we weren't sent in the day, that would’ve been much easier. But apparently we had to be sent in the evening, because that's when most disappearances happened. It was getting late, we had to go in, although nervous. All we saw were some boxes and damaged walls, there was even dark brown stains on the walls, we had no idea what it was. “You ever feel like you might be being watched?” Paul said, anxious. “Yeah, we should get out of here, this place is starting to creep me out and I don't know why.” James noted. “It's just because it's dark, that's all. When it's night, your imagination is more active.” That might be true, but a chill went down my spine as I got the same feeling.\n\n",

But I brushed it off because as soon as I looked away, it was gone. John was paying close attention to the cartoon, how it didn't blink very often, how it was almost always watching the camera as if it knew we were behind the screen. James started to get the tune of the cartoon stuck in his head, he started humming it, occasionally saying out loud “Da ba dee da da da dow..” though none of us really knew what the lyrics really meant, or even what they were.\n\n",

The cat was chasing the mouse around in circles, but then stopped, and hit the mouse on the head with a hammer that you'd see in that hit the mole game. Then james swore he felt a wooden object, cylindrical and big, just like the hammer in the cartoon, strike the back of his head. We got slightly unnerved.\n\n",

We all turned around, to see a face, just like Felix the Cat, staring back at us, except it wasn't Felix. It was an evil presence completely. The teeth were visibly dirty, and dripping with blood. The eyes were lined with pink on the edges. The TV switched to the cat grabbing the mouse, and the monster we saw in front of us spiraled its arm towards John, and picked him up by his hoodie. It laughed in the most villainous laugh I’d ever heard.\n\n",

It was the most traumatizing thing I've seen, and I have seen some of the scariest things at my job. I had to watch my other friends get their limbs torn off, I tried to save one, but it only caused more pain as their bones splintered like wood. The cartoon cat spoke, “You're next,” and I ran, I slid under the arm and ran as fast as I could. I managed to escape before its stretched arm could grab me. Years later, I still get the feeling that it’s watching me... following me everywhere I go..\n\n",
