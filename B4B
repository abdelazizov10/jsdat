      "Content":"The biggest key to avoiding frustration with Back 4 Blood’s difficulty is understanding how its design differs from Left 4 Dead. You aren’t meant to beat this campaign on Veteran or higher difficulty on your first try, even if you’re the most grizzled of Left 4 Dead veterans."

      "Content":"Back 4 Blood uses a deck building system, similar to what you’d see in many roguelite games. The first time you face the campaign, and particularly the much more difficult second half, you’re likely to run into trouble. The default, prebuilt deck will only get you so far. You'll need the best cards if you want to survive until the end."

      "Content":"For example, Walker increases everyone's health, whilst Evangelo and Holly increase team speed and stamina respectively. Every character is solid, and you can play to their strengths through deck building. However, on Nightmare difficulty, you’re going to need the best team you can get."

      "Content":"More Left 4 Dead differences! Back 4 Blood has more complicated weapons, which include attachment slots you can modify over the course of a campaign. Attachments can be purchased at the buy station in each safe house or found over the course of a campaign. Most of these are straightforward and include descriptions of the stats they provide. There are over 30 weapons to choose from, so check out the best weapons in Back 4 Blood if you need help narrowing down the selection."

      "Content":"Some weapons found on the ground will also have broken attachments that have stat penalties instead of bonuses. Keep an eye out for red attachments; these are the broken ones. Unfortunately, you can’t just pop them off either. If you find an attachment for the same slot though, you can replace the damaged part. I’ve seen a lot of players wondering how to remove weapon attachments in Back 4 Blood, and this is the only way right now."

Whether you are playing on recruit, veteran, or nightmare difficulty, you can get overwhelmed by a few Tallboys and Hockers very quickly, leaving your team scattered, bruised, and on the brink of death."
